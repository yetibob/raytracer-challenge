# The Raytracer Challenge

This repo is a collection of 3-D renderers in various languages that follow along with the The Raytracer Challenger book. The purpose of continually reimplementing a raytracer in different programming languages is fairly simple. Building a Raytracer is complex enough that it makes an excellent project for learning new languages. It is essentially an incredibly thorough "hello world" application to really learn and evaluate a given programming language.
